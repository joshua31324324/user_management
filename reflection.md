# Introduction
  To start off, I learned how to incorporate Object-Oriented Programming into my coding work. While I had already learned Python the previous semester, I didn’t understand how to put it into action until I joined this class. I now know how to make a decent program in python, and have been working on my own personal projects.
  While the work in this class was initially simple (as Ive used GitHub in the past), it quickly turned difficult, and I often struggled to finish assignments to the best of my ability. As a result, I wasn’t as prepared for this project as much as I wanted to.
# The Project
  On this project, I had to set up my very own User Management System, add a feature to it, and make 10 tests. However, while trying to set up the system, I noticed that the fastapi service (the web framework needed for the application to run in the first place) wasn’t working. As a result, I had to manually go into the file that was causing problems (alembic\versions\25d814bc83ed_initial_migration.py), and try to fix it.  In order to fix it, I had to change the name of multiple files to prevent duplicates. This took me about half the allotted time for the project, so I was forced to rush my work.
# The Features
  I chose what appeared to be the easiest feature to add: enhancing the user profile management. It allowed users to update their profile feeds and upgrade their accounts to professional status. In order to do this, I had to go into my files, analyze them to see which one(s) managed the profile code and database schema, edit them to include the new API endpoints, and updated the database to accept these changes. Because I was running low on time, I was unable to add optional enhancements to the profile (i.e., a user-friendly interface) and had to repeat some tests over and over again.
# What I Learned
  From this project, I learned how to deploy a mini-application from GitHub to Docker, as well as how to run FastAPI. Because I feel like I did not have enough time to fully understand the inner workings of the app, I will come back to this project at a later time when I am more free. This will allow me to have a better idea on how to building my own web applications, which could help me get a successful career in the future.
